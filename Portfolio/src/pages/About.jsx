            <p className="text-[#1c1c1c] dark:text-[#B5B5B5] leading-7 text-[18px]">I'm KemfonAbasi Jonah — a frontend developer with a particular obsession with the intersection of aesthetics and technical precision. My work spans luxury restaurant interfaces, Airbnb-style booking platforms, and portfolio sites that stand out in a sea of templates..</p>
            <p className="text-[#1c1c1c] dark:text-[#B5B5B5] leading-7 text-[18px]">I approach every project thinking about the gap between what a user expects and what would actually surprise them — in the best way. Whether it's a scroll-triggered reveal, a filter transition, or a navigation that disappears at exactly the right moment, the details matter.</p>
            <p className="text-[#1c1c1c] dark:text-[#B5B5B5] leading-7 text-[18px]">Currently deepening my skills across the full stack and building publicly on GitHub. Open to freelance projects and developer roles where craft is taken seriously.</p>
